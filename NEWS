0.1-5	2011-07-07
	*	Support for setting/getting cell formulas. See methods
		set/getCellFormula.
	*	Support for setting/getting the force formula recalculation flag on
		worksheets. See methods set/getForceFormulaRecalculation.
	*	Support for setting auto-filters via the setAutoFilter method.
	*	There is a set of new utility functions:
		- aref2idx, idx2aref: Converts Excel area references (such as A5:D14)
		  to row & column based cell references and vice versa.
		- aref: Constructs an Excel area reference from a specification of the
		  top left corner and the dimensionality of an object.
		- getReferenceCoordinates: Queries the coordinates of an Excel name
		  representing an Excel area reference (such as A5:D14)

0.1-4	2011-05-26
	*	An issue was fixed where cell styles would not be applied correctly.
	*	There is a new style action called NONE: This style action instructs 
		XLConnect to apply no cell styles when writing data. Cell styles are kept 
		as they are. This is useful in a scenario where all styling is predefined 
		in an Excel template which is then only filled with data.
	*	There is a new DATA_FORMAT_ONLY style action: This style action instructs
		XLConnect to only set the data format for a cell but not to apply any other 
		styling but rather keep the existing one. The data format to be applied is 
		determined by the corresponding R data type and can be defined by the user. 
		This style action may be useful in scenarios where Excel templates with 
		pre-defined styling are to be filled with XLConnect.
	*	Worksheets can be renamed with the new renameSheet method.
	*	The positions (indices) of worksheets can be queried & redefined using the 
		new methods getSheetPos & setSheetPos.
	*	Worksheets can be cloned using the new method cloneSheet.
	*	There is a set of new utility functions:
		- col2idx, idx2col: Converts Excel column names such as BD to indices and 
		  vice versa.
		- cref2idx, idx2cref: Converts cell references to row & column indices and 
		  vice versa.
	*	Setting a missing value string when writing missing values from R to Excel. 
		By default missing values result in blank/empty cells. This is to have a nice 
		type mapping between R and Excel. In some cases, however, you might want to 
		define a specific missing value string to be used by XLConnect when writing 
		cells representing missing values instead of blank/empty cells. This can be 
		done using the new method setMissingValue.
	*	The handling of error cells (cells that result in an error when trying to 
		evaluate them) has been greatly improved. With XLConnect 0.1-3 error cells 
		directly resulted in an exception. With XLConnect 0.1-4 this behavior can 
		be controlled using the onErrorCell method. By default error cells now result 
		in a missing value and the corresponding error cells will be reported via 
		warnings. The behavior may be changed to get an exception with the first 
		occurrence of an error cell.
	*	There is two new methods for merging & un-merging cells: mergeCells & 
		unmergeCells.
